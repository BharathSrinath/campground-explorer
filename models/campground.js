// About different usage of id syntax:
// In MongoDB, the unique identifier for each document is automatically named _id. So when we're working directly with the database or Mongoose, we will use _id to refer to the documentâ€™s identifier.
// On the other hand, when we are working with Express routes and middleware, id is just a parameter name that we have chosen in our route definition.
